# VPNSetup

This windows application needs admin privileges to run. It has following functonalities:

CONFIGURE HOSTED NETWORK
1. Create hostedNetwork - It runs netsh commands and creates a new hostedNetwork for you.
2. Connect to hostedNetwork - It starts the hostedNetwork.
3. Show password - Displays hostedNetwork password.
4. Change password - Allows you to change the hostedNetwork password.

CONFIGURE EXPRESS VPN ADAPTER
1. Enable express VPN Adapter if disabled. The windows library doesnt recognize the adapters if they are disabled.
2. Add the running hosted network to the adapter.

The software takes care of the above mentioned steps. Then you need to start Express VPN by selecting the preffered location.
The vpn is shared now. You can connect your TV and phone and other computer to the hosted network and enjoy the benefits of express vpn over the shared network.

Work In Progess:
 Software works fine but there is some issues with the internet availability in the shared connection. I am working on that.
